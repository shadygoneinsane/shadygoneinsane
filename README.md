## About Me
<p>Hello! I am Vikesh Dass, an experienced and passionate Software Engineer specializing in Android development. With a strong background in Java and Kotlin programming languages, I have been actively contributing to the world of mobile applications for several years.


I am currently a Staff Engineer (Lead) at Nagarro, directly involved with a prominent [Mobile Banking client in Abu Dhabi, UAE.](https://www.adib.ae/en) <Br>
Leading a team of eight developers, I focus on multiple Android applications, excelling in requirement gathering, designing, and developing while following Scrum and best coding practices.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Developer at Bharti Airtel, optimizing code and enhancing user experience for the "My Airtel" app. Earlier, I developed a user-friendly consumer Android app at Lucideus for assessing device security.

Beyond my professional engagements, I am an avid learner, actively staying updated with the latest trends in Android development. My passion led me to create "Keep Me Out," an app aimed at helping people overcome device-addiction issues, built using Kotlin and MVVM pattern.
